# Description
This project is designed to simplify the process of creating Sora 2 AI videos using the API and a web interface.

# How it works?
The tool connects to the Sora 2 API to handle video generation requests. Users can define video parameters through a simple web interface, and the system automatically sends them to the API. Once the video is processed, the result becomes available for preview and download.

# Requirements🛠
- Sora 2 API key (you can get it [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- Python 3.10+
- Windows/MacOS/Linux
- At least 4GB of RAM

# Installation

## **Install notice:** 
Windows and macOS users, please follow the manual installation. macOS users can also get it via the downloadable [DMG file](../../releases).

Before using the tool, you need to set it up on your PC. Clone it using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tensanimwa306/sora2-api
```
**Then you need to install the dependencies:**
```bash
cd sora2-api
pip install requirements.txt
```

# Usage
To start using the program, you need to configure it first.  
Create a `.env` file:
```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

Then, add your Sora 2 API key to the .env file: 
```bash
API_KEY=  # your API key here
```
After that, launch the `main.py` file:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will open a web page in your browser where you can configure and generate your videos directly.

You can switch between text-to-video and image-to-video modes. Once the video is processed, it becomes available for download.
